print(10 + 3)
print(10 - 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3)

print(10 // 3)  # results in integer value
print(10 % 3)  # MODULUS - results in remainder
print(10 ** 3)  # POWER - raised to the power

# Augmented Assignment Operator
x = 10
x = 3

print(x)
# instead of x = x + 10 we can write x+=10, We can do this for every Arithmetic operator
